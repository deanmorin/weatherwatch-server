weatherwatch-server
===================

Parses, stores, and analyzes weather data from Environment Canada

After cloning the repository, run:

$ xmlparsing.py devel
$ accuracy.py devel

This will get you the latest data from Environment Canada and store it in the
database. A populated database is necessary to run some of the unit tests.
